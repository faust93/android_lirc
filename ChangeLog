	lircd: Don't shutdown systemd's socket (#72).
	Patch from mailing list:
	https://sourceforge.net/p/lirc/mailman/message/33058462/

	>From
	>http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.socket.html:

	> [...]
	> However, it must not unlink the socket from a file
	> system. It should not invoke shutdown(2) on sockets
	> it got with Accept=false, but it may do so for
	> sockets it got with Accept=true set.
	> [...]

	lircd does always shutdown the socket, so when lircd.service is stopped,
	lircd.socket enters failed state stating that the service unexpectedly
	shutdown the socket.

	Attached patches for 0.9.1 and 0.9.2 (master) fixes this problem for me.

	lib, lircrcd: Move lircrcd sockets to /var/run (#62).
	This is not completely compatible with the old behaviour: previously, if
	the files had the same paths but different basenames they got different
	lircrd sockets. This patch makes all lircrc files with the same basename
	use the same socket. Can't think of any usecase where this is a problem

	As of now we also support lircrc_class which can be used to walk around
	this limitation.

	The old code actually allowed the use of other commands than lircrcd as
	interpreter in the shebang. This was never documented or an official
	interface. It's not supported with this patch.

	Patch solves all sorts of problems related to using sockets in the same
	directory as config files.

	lib: Add new lircrc_class global lircrc option (#61).
	Adds a new global option lircrc_class to lircrc format. The
	format is simple

	    lircrc_class <string>

	The string is used as argument when creating lircrc sockets. The
	shebang is parsed as a lircrc_class <basename filename> i. e.,
	it emulates the old behaviour to create a socket named after
	the lircrc config file.

	The shebang is deprecated and usage gives  a warning.

	lirc_class can only be used in the toplevel config file, not
	in included ones. If found in an included file it generates
	a warning but is otherwise ignored. Same goes for bad syntax.

	Fixing configure.html + some tests.

	'could not detach kernel driver' error.

	Upon further digging between lirc and libusb, I noticed that error codes
	changed recently, and lirc was entering the if that triggers that error
	due to libusb returning another type of error (EINVAL) instead of the
	original one (ENODATA). The patch treats both of these the same way.

2014-08-26  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	drv_admin: Create new interface to list all plugins  (part of #27).
	Refactor current code and provide ahook also to visit each plugin,
	not just each driver.

	lirc-setup, NEWS: Try to handle python-yaml dependency.

	lib: Remove lirc_options from driver lib.
	We don't use options from the drivers, they are note included and
	thus we don't need the libraries linked. Nuke and proceed.

	logging: Enable symbolic constants in UI, clean up.
	Users should be able to set the loglevel using the familiar
	'info', 'warning' etc. Add interfaces in lirc_log to parse
	loglevels and in options to store them. New code in client's
	option parsing + various cleanup of leftovers from the time
	debug was a boolean, not a level. Adding some tests.

	logging: Converting debug to a loglevel.
	The global debug variable has since long been used as a level.
	This has not been reflected in code. Change name on
	debug ->loglevel, and make the possible values for loglevel an
	enum. Lot's of changes in clients using logprintf/LOGPRINTF.
	Some plugins's use of LOGPRINTF sanitized.

	plugins: Add linker flags for iguanaIR

	plugins: constantness fixes.

	plugins: Rebasing irtoy to current master, build update.

2014-08-25  Matt Ward  <mward@wtmi.net>

	plugins: Add irtoy driver (#20).
	Adds the plugins/irtoy.c driver for the Dangerous
	Prototypes USB Infrared Toy 2.  Original patch information created
	by Peter Kooiman.  I have read references that it might not be as
	up-to-date as desired due to "robustness" changes in the transmit
	command protocol.  This current set works to transmit and receive.
	It even works with the irrecord utility.

	This has been tested with the "latest" v22 firmware images on the
	IRToy2 as well as with a "beta" (?) v23 one that no one seems to
	be supporting, other than to make it available.

2014-08-25  Bengt Martensson  <bulk@bengt-martensson.de>

	Remove unnecessary and silly sorting of remotes (#28).
	The idea is probably to make the program faster in that remotes with
	"shorter" codes comes at the beginning, and thus (?) leads to faster
	decoding. However, this idea is both badly implemented (raw remotes
	comes out with a bit length of 0, so they will always be at the
	beginning), and is also counter productive, because the only sensible
	performance related optimization of lircd.conf is when the user manually
	reorders the file with more commonly used remotes first. The (for the
	user invisible!) re-ordering undoes his careful work!

	Fix in code consists of just removing the sorting.

2014-08-25  Alec Leamas  <leamas@nowhere.net>

	Add some (very) basic unit tests (part of #11).

2014-08-20  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	configure: Handle missing ALSA properly.

	configure: Don't require kernel sources.
	We only build user-space tools and should thus never require
	kernel sources. The thing we actually need (lirc.h) is a kernel
	bug, and we bundle it until the kernel exports is as it should.

2014-08-20  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	configure, lircd: Still more config cruft.
	The --devdir option to configure makes no sense, it's where
	kernel devices are installed. We have no such devices after
	removing the kernel modules, the named pipes we use lives
	in $(varrundir) i. e., /var/run.

	The device dir is till a hardcoded default in many drivers,
	but after all we normally doesn't use these defaults, we
	set the device as a runtime option.

	We should not carry the file include/media/lirc.h, it's the kernels
	task. But until this bug is fixed, lets install the file so that
	drivers kan be compiled without kernel sources.

	The m4 definitions are redundant, automake distributes (of course)
	it's own include directory.

2014-08-18  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	plugins: Remove some silly headers.

	daemons: Move irrecord and slinke elsewhere (#15).

	lircd, devinput: Move code for setting rc device from lircd -> driver.

	doc: Update manpages on driver loading and FILES, bugfixes.

2014-08-18  Alec Leamas  <leamas@nowhere.net>

	configure.ac: Nuke last path definitions.
	Defining paths in configure.c is generally  a Bad Idea, since these
	are unknown at the time of autoconf/automake. And there is really
	no need to configure default device names and plugindir,
	they might as well be hardcoded.

	doc/Makefile.am: Cornercase bugfix.

2014-08-15  Martin Tharby Jones  <https://sourceforge.net/u/emteejay/profile>

	mode2: Add a gap parameter and 'scope' like display mode.
	The gap parameter is needed so that the column display mode can display
	each IR transmission burst separately for any remote. The default  value
	has been set to a lower value than the original hard-coded one to better
	match the timings from existing configuration files.

	The 'scope display mode draws a simple ASCII trace of the IR signal.

	DEBUG: Remove unneeded configuration option.
	All debug output is now governed by run-time options. Having #ifdef DEBUG
	creates many problems when users needs to recompile lirc whne running
	into bugs. There is a performance hit, but it's basically just an integer
	comparison when output is disabled.

	Builds not defining DEBUG are also likely to be untested sine most devs
	always have it on. On the contrary, many distros have it disabled, so
	mosgt users have it disabled. This is not a reasonable situation.

2014-08-13  Alec Leamas  <leamas@nowhere.net>

	DAEMONIZE: Purge unneeded configuration option.

	doc: Ditch help2man, use traditional manpage sources.
	The current manpage generation is a mess. The dependencies are unclear,
	and the generated files are not flexible enough to create descent
	manpages. Also, creating manpages for non-commands e. g., config files
	requires wrappers. All in all, a mess.

	Remove release-html and release-man scripts, do everything in the
	Makefile.am. Check in current generated manpages as source and fix them
	up.

	This also opens up for traditional keyword substitution in the generated
	files. Currently only version is patched, but this is easily expanded.

2014-08-07  Alec Leamas  <leamas@nowhere.net>

	build: Add pkgconfig .pc files.

2014-08-07  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	remotes/sonyir: Rename and revise key symbols.
	The vendor name is sony, not sonyir. Renaming to conform with
	the others.

	Revising symbols using lirc-config-tool, renaming keys starting
	with KEY_ to X_KEY_.... The basic contract is that a symbol
	starting with KEY_ is an official symbol.

2014-08-07  Alec Leamas  <leamas@nowhere.net>

	doc: Ditch help2man, use traditional manpage sources.
	The current manpage generation is a mess. The dependencies are unclear,
	and the generated files are not flexible enough to create descent
	manpages. Also, creating manpages for non-commands e. g., config files
	requires wrappers. All in all, a mess.

	Remove release-html and release-man scripts, do everything in the
	Makefile.am. Check in current generated manpages as source and fix them
	up.

	This also opens up for traditional keyword substitution in the generated
	files. Currently only version is patched, but this is easily expanded.

	Removing generation of table.html and lirc.hwdb for now, to be
	re-enabled later when there is new configuration system in place.

2014-08-07  Alec Leamas  <leamas@nowhere.net>

	configure.ac: Bugfix and cleanup.
	Fix missed else clause for some AM_CONDITIONL leading to undefined
	automake variables in some situations. Remove the "possible_drivers"
	variable, a left-over from configuring lirc with specific a specific
	driver.

	autogen.sh: Bugfix.

	lircd: Fix --output option parsing bug.

	contrib: ...regression-test.sh: Update list of ignored files.

	doc: html updates

	doc: manpages update.

	doc: manpage(s) fix.

	setup.sh: obsolete setup script, removed.

2014-07-31  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	build: Don't try to install a configuration time decided config file.
	We don't really support building a single driver anymore, so just
	drop installation af specific config files. These should be selected
	at installation time, not configuration.

	Split some excessively long lines.

2014-07-31  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	main: Makefile.am: Fix "make distcheck" errors.

2014-07-31  Alec Leamas  <leamas@nowhere.net>

	configure et. al.: bugfix (bad)
	Old code tried to evaluate installation paths at configure time,
	which never works using autotools.

2014-07-31  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	autotools: Don't allow configuring a single driver.
	With drivers loaded dynamically, it makes no sense to configure
	just one. User can just build one driver later on, by using
	the Makefile in plugins dir. Or she can build all but just
	use a subset at  installation time. Simplifies configure.ac a lot.

	Clean up last directory fixes in configure.ac, those are now
	in plugins/Makefile.am in a simplified form.

2014-07-31  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	configure: Update hardware heuristics.

	configure: Remove odd messages for drivers now in kernel.

	autotools: Remove hw_module_libs.

	configure: Remove some unused constants.

2014-07-31  Alec Leamas  <leamas@nowhere.net>

	plugins: Disable debug output in runtime, not configure time.

2014-07-31  Alec Leamas  <leamas@nowhere.net>

	irrecord, lircd, lirc_log, : more logging fixes.
	irrecord contains some code which unconditionally outputs debug
	messages if #DEBUG is enabled at configuration time. This
	makes it hard to ship builds with debug  functions enabled, which
	is  Bad Thing.

	Replace staic #ifdef's with runtime tests based on debug variable.
	New interface in lirc_log.h

2014-07-31  Alec Leamas  <leamas@nowhere.net>

	daemons-lib: fix logging.
	Current logging has problems with the combination nodaemon and
	running as a server - the stderr logging does not work (perhaps
	systemd screws up the LOG_PERROR syslog option). Furthermore,
	these routines used to filter calls to syslog using the value of
	the global debug variable. This makes just no sense, the syslog
	priority system works well as-is.

	Also, the LOGPRINTF macro simply ignored the priority argument,
	logging everything as LOG_DEBUG.

	Patch ensures that logging to stderr always takes place when
	running as nodaemon, making interactive users and systemd happy.
	syslog messages are  unfiltered, syslog decides whether to log
	or not. Other messages (logfile, stderr) are filtered using global
	debug; priority arguments are always respected.

2014-07-31  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	plugins: Update include headers, use "lirc_driver.h".
	Just include the official "lirc_driver.h" header in drivers, part
	of disconnecting them from the erst of the source.

	Revert "main: Makefile: temporary fix for drivers/lirc.h"
	Reverts commit fed9c64bb (to be rebased). It's no longer needed,
	there are no references to drivers/lirc.h left.

2014-07-31  Alec Leamas  <alec@tests.notat.diaspora.com>

	doc: Add section on dynamic loading to manpages.

2014-07-31  Alec Leamas  <leamas@nowhere.net>

	tools: Don't build or document unbuildable tools.
	Disable build of xmode2/smode2 in cases they can't be built.

2014-07-31  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	tools: Build against new library.
	Remove all references to the daemons dir, everything common
	is in lib/.  The static driver library is no longer needed.
	slinke needs to rename progname after a name clash.

	daemons: Don't build static drivers lib, cleanup.
	Since hw-types don't link to the drivers anymore, we don't need
	this. Skip the static lib, link dynamically against --lirc and
	remove the source compatibility symlinks which was needed to
	build the static lib.

	plugins: hw_default: fix name clash + includes

	plugins: Add an entrypoint for loader.
	Each plugin contains one or more driver definitions. The loader
	looks for list called "hardwares"; let's add this to each plugin.

	plugins: Remove hw_ prefix.

	plugins: Update autotools to build separate .so files.

	Moving userspace drivers to separate directory.

	lib: Adding a driver library.

	daemons, tools: Build against new library.
	There are at least four more or less copy-pasted waitfordata()
	functions out there. The one in lircd i more elaborated, though.
	Picking the one in irrecord, which looks the same as the ones
	in mode2 and xmode2. Placing function in receive, which looks
	natural. Moving stuff from daemons and tools to library.

	ac-path-kernel-source: Fixes for bundled lirc.h

2014-07-31  Alec Leamas  <leamas.alec@gmail.com>

	Handle the bundled lirc.h header.
	The lirc.h header in the package is a bundled kernel header. Add
	code which uses the kernel header if it exists, defaulting to
	the bundled copy in the source tree.

	lib: Make it buildable.

	lib: Moving files from daemons to new lib directory.

2014-06-11  Alec Leamas  <leamas@nowhere.net>

	build: Ripping out last kernel module wpc87691
	This leaves the drivers directory detached from the main
	build setup. Not being part of lirc but rather the kernel
	this is the most reasonable approach.

	wpc8769l: Add separated kernel Makefile, detach from lirc build system.

	wpc8769l: updating to new kernel macros, fix includes, updates.
	Mke the driver compile against current kernel, drop support
	for old 2.6- kernels.
